# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Always love to help others by combining my experiences in engineering, design and web development to build user-friendly digital applications. I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions. 
I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter. 

My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. 
Iâ€™m a fast learner, and love challenges. Always eager to learn something new.
In my free time, I enjoy reading self-motivation books and singing. Sometimes take a lot of photography while travelling.

Feel free to send me a message if you want to collaborate on projects or just want to connect.
