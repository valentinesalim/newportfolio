# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Love to help others by combining my experiences in engineering, design and web development to build user-friendly digital applications. I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions.

Iâ€™m a fast learner, and love challenges. I tend to have high expectations towards my works and never settle for less. Always looking for ways to improve the efficiency of my life and the world around me. In my free time, I enjoy reading self-motivation books and singing. Sometimes take a lot of photos while travelling.

Feel free to send me a message if you want to collaborate on projects or just want to connect.
