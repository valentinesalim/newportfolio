#### **My profile**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**. <br>
Welcome to my personal website, here I will update some of my personal projects or any interest that got me into. I spent most of time learning new stuff while studying Electronic Information Engineering at North China University of Technology (2018-2022).

I like making internet friends, or if you want to collaborate on projects, feel free to reach me out and connect.
