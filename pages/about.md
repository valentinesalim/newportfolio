### Hi! I'm **Valentine Salim**

Designing & Developing product is my hobby.
The same way you all like to do things that interests you. For me too, it's simply
prolonging something I enjoy doing. That's why I only take on projects that pique
my interest.

Currently, I'm into competitive hackathons, attending it during the weekends. Won some of it.
