## Inspiration
Not all of us can contribute to donations and not all of us can walk in the protests for campaigns we care about. But all of us can feel injustice. And instead of ranting about injustice, each of us can make a difference.

The fact is, you have the skills that others want to learn. We believe that everyone has something valuable they can teach others. We believe that everyone is a good person who cares about something bigger than themselves, whether it’s social justice, the refugee crisis, climate change, food insecurity, animal welfare, etc. Why not **#Teach4ACause?**

## What it does
**Teach 4A Cause** is an online learning-crowdfunding platform where specialized teachers from indicated backgrounds or professional can create a class, and the earnings would be utilized for helping other people/ a cause. As Campaign Host, they can teach a class in any field they are passionate about. Think of it as donating your time for impact — so they can use their resources to make the most effective impact for a good cause :)

We believe kindness has no barrier. So join our platform, and help us make the world a better place, by **#Teach4ACause**


## How we built it
We built this app using React.js. The frontend was prototyped with Figma and implemented with vanilla Javascript & the styling in CSS. Firebase's SDK was used as a backend service for providing user authorization & authentication. Two databases, MongoDB & Firestore were chained together and were used for storing user datas & for handling interdependant schemas. This allowed us to receive data from both ends, which we then processed on the viewport. The app is currently hosted on the Netlify which includes a free SSL for more security on the application layer.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge of this entire project was definitely working vitually. All of us are from different timezones & we had to sync our times with respect to each others & then build it. Also, taking to the technical part, we also faced several problems while chaining two different NoSQL data bases with each other. Then comes the real part, fixing merge conflicts. It had to be done manually, which took a lot of time which we could have invested in building new feature or polishing the existing one.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed like a tough task as all of us were working from different timezones & were also able to add most of the features that we envisioned for the app during ideation.

## What we learned
A lot of things, both summed up in technical & non-technical sides. For the technical side, we got to learn so much on configuring routes and setting up auth channels between DB's. Adding to that we also gained some UI/UX skills. Not to mention, Stackoverflow was the gem for us while we're troubleshooting some complicated issues late-night.

## What's next for Teach For A Cause
We're going to go through many changes & planning to add the following updates to the project in the future,
- Collaboration features between course instructures.
- Additional layers of security.
- Add option to filter more categories between courses.
