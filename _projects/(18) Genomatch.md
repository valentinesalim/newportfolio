## Inspiration
Is love really just a cheek swab away?

We live in a golden age of online dating, where complex algorithms and innovative apps promise to pinpoint your perfect romantic match in no time. And yet, dating remains as tedious and painful as ever. A seemingly unlimited supply of swipes and likes has resulted not in effortless pairings, but in chronic dating-app fatigue. Nor does online dating seem to be shortening the time we spend looking for mates; Tinder reports that its users spend up to 90 minutes swiping per day.

## What it does
But what if there was a way to analyze your DNA and match you to your ideal genetic partner—allowing you to cut the line of endless left-swipes and awkward first dates? That’s where our solution comes in, GenoMatch is a genetics-based dating apps matching potential partners based on their DNA and personality compatibility.

The theory behind DNA-matching is that certain genes connected to your immune system, known as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), heavily influence the kind of person you are attracted to. This level of connection would, in theory, ensure you are attracted to each other in the real world, beyond the carefully-crafted profile pictures.

This app will also pair you with people who have the least amount of genetic risk to prevent your kids from having genetic diseases. We sure don't want our biologic children to suffer those problems, right? This is one of the solutions.


## How it works?
- You register and fill in your detail information (including DNA and 16Personalities result).
- Fill in your interest and match preference.
- Our algorithm will match you with partners based on your DNA and Personality compatibility. But you're free to explore and find your match outside our recommendation too.
- Say Hello and Date! <3

## Challenges we ran into
Since all of us not coming from bioinformatics, it takes time to research and learn about the topic of bioinformatics. But it was a fun experience, learned a lot!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We ship on time!

## What we learned
We learned how to divide our responsibilities and roles, we did a lot of research and gain insights about DNA-matchmaking.

## What's next for GenoMatch
 Recently, We got many messages in discord telling us to make this project a reality... and we're thinking about it...just wait for it! We hope to make a collaboration with DNA experts and having more advance algorithm for the matchmaking and connect it with the Genome API.
